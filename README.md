# Honeypot-Experiment


🔁 Upgrade #1: Honeypot → Mini Adversary Emulation
Add one improvement:
Correlate attack patterns over time
Classify attackers by behavior (brute-force, automation, manual)
Add detection logic (Fail2ban, Sigma rules, Suricata alerts)
New interview framing:
“I deployed an SSH honeypot and then analyzed attacker behavior to distinguish automated attacks from human-driven activity.”
That instantly sounds senior.
